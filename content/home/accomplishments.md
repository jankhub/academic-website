  description = "Combinatorial optimization problems are concerned with the efficient allocation of limited resources to meet desired objectives when the values of the variables are restricted to be integral. Such problems arise in various applications, e.g., airline crew scheduling, manufacturing, network design, cellular telephone frequency design, and they can often be modeled as optimization problems on graphs. The course deals with several basic combinatorial optimization problems. While these problems are intrinsically hard to solve in general, we will present polynomial-time solvable instances. Algorithms use combinatorial tools, linear and semidefinite programming."

  description = "Game theory studies interactive decision situations involving conflict and/or cooperation. In cooperative games binding agreements are allowed and the players may form coalitions. The focus is on the question how to reallocate the resulting joint coalitional payoff among the players in a fair way."

  description = "Randomness has proven itself to be a useful resource for developing provably efficient algorithms and protocols. This course will explore examples from a variety of settings and problem areas such as graph algorithms, algorithms in algebra, approximate counting, probabilistically checkable proofs, algorithms for big data, and matrix algorithms. Topics also include an introduction to tools from probability theory, including matringales, Chernoff bounds and Lovasz Local lemma."

  description = "The theory of Markov decision processes (MDPs) - also known under the names sequential decision theory, stochastic control or stochastic dynamic programming - studies sequential optimization of stochastic systems by controlling their transition mechanism over time. Each control policy defines a stochastic process and values of objective functions associated with this process. The goal is to select a control policy that optimizes a function of the values generated by the utility functions. In real life, decisions that are made usually have two types of impact. Firstly, they cost or save resources, such as money or time. Secondly, by influencing the dynamics of the system they have an impact on the future as well. Therefore, the decision with the largest immediate profit may not be good in view of future rewards in many situations. MDPs model this paradigm and can be used to model many important applications in practice. In this course we provide results on the structure and existence of good policies, on methods for the computation of optimal policies, and illustrate them by applications."

  description = "The primary goal of this hands-on course is to enable Ph.D. students to make a good research design for their own research project. To this end, it provides an interactive training in various elements of research design, such as the conceptual design and the research planning. But the course also contains a general introduction to the philosophy of science (and particularly to the philosophy of mathematics, computer science and AI). And, it addresses such divergent topics as 'the case-study method', 'elementary research methodology for the empirical sciences' and 'empirical methods for computer science'."

  description = "This course intends to help PhD-students to manage their project effecitvely by optimising the success factors (technical conditions, supervision, planning, social and expert network) and practising personal communication skills. These personal communication techniques, involving feedback, conflicts, negotiations, and other subjects are practised with an actor."

  description = "Stochastic programming is a framework for modelling optimization problems that involve uncertainty. Whereas deterministic optimization problems are formulated with known parameters, real world problems almost invariably include some unknown parameters. When the parameters are known only within certain bounds, one approach to tackling such problems is called robust optimization. Here the goal is to find a solution which is feasible for all such data and optimal in some sense. Stochastic programming models are similar in style but take advantage of the fact that probability distributions governing the data are known or can be estimated. The goal here is to find some policy that is feasible for all (or almost all) the possible data instances and maximizes the expectation of some function of the decisions and the random variables. More generally, such models are formulated, solved analytically or numerically, and analyzed in order to provide useful information to a decision-maker. The most widely applied and studied stochastic programming models are two-stage linear programs. Here the decision maker takes some action in the first stage, after which a random event occurs affecting the outcome of the first-stage decision. A recourse decision can then be made in the second stage that compensates for any bad effects that might have been experienced as a result of the first-stage decision. The optimal policy from such a model is a single first-stage policy and a collection of recourse decisions (a decision rule) defining which second-stage action should be taken in response to each random outcome."

  description = "Data Science is one of the most penetrating research trends of the last few years, and is finding more and more applications. Data Science techniques are also getting to be used as an instrument for other research purposes. The objective of this tutorial is to provide a kaleidoscopic overview of current trends, for both students in data science and students whose research is not primarily data science. Some presentations will take an application or industry perspective, some present ongoing research. The first day features several presentations on the data aspect (data quality, data cleansing), the second day is focused on analytics (such as an introduction into deep learning)."
