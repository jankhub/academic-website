I am a Ph.D. Student in the <a href="https://www.cwi.nl/research/groups/stochastics">Stochastics</a> group of the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science) and in both the <a href="https://www.math.vu.nl/en/research/analytics-and-optimization/index.aspx">Analytics & Optimization</a> and the <a href="https://www.cs.vu.nl/ci/">Computational Intelligence</a> group of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. My research is funded by the Dutch Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations and is part of the project "Development of Data Analytics, Data Science and Crypto Analytics techniques" together with Ph.D. Student <a href="https://www.cwi.nl/people/joris-pries">Joris Pries</a>, trainee <a href="https://www.cwi.nl/people/etienne-van-de-bijl">Etienne van de Bijl</a> and supervisors <a href="https://www.cwi.nl/people/rob-van-der-mei">Rob van der Mei</a>, <a href="https://www.math.vu.nl/~sbhulai/">Sandjai Bhulai</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.vu.nl/~mhoogen/">Mark Hoogendoorn</a>.

My research is focused on the development of machine learning techniques for anomaly detection. These methods are primarily applied in the field of cybersecurity to identify harmful network traffic in large sets of cyberdata. I am mainly working on ways to reduce the number of false alarms without missing potentially fatal cyberattacks. At the moment, I am studying Active Learning, which utilizes the knowledge of human cyberexperts in order to enhance the classification of either benign or malicious network connections.
